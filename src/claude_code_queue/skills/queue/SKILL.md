# Claude Queue Skill

`claude-queue` queues prompts for Claude Code with automatic rate-limit
retry. Use it proactively when tasks are complex, rate-limit-prone, or
when the user asks to queue something.

## When to Proactively Suggest Queuing

Suggest using claude-queue when you notice:
- The task involves many sequential tool calls that may hit the usage limit
- The user says "run this later" or "I'll come back to this"
- The user describes a batch of similar tasks (multiple files, features, etc.)
- A rate limit was already hit in this session

Example: "This refactor spans many files and may hit API limits midway.
Want me to queue it with `claude-queue` so it retries automatically?"

## Core Commands

```bash
# Quick add (short prompts, no context files needed)
claude-queue add "Fix the auth bug" --priority 1 --working-dir /path/to/project

# Create a detailed template file (complex prompts with context)
claude-queue template task-name --priority 2

# Check queue
claude-queue status --detailed
claude-queue list --status queued

# Start the daemon (runs prompts, auto-retries on rate limit)
claude-queue start

# Cancel a queued prompt
claude-queue cancel <prompt-id>

# List sessions (ids + titles) for the current project
claude-queue sessions

# Continue THIS session later, when the usage limit resets
claude-queue resume-session
```

## Continuing a Rate-Limited Session

When the current session hits the usage limit mid-task, suggest queuing its
continuation rather than starting the work over later:

```bash
claude-queue resume-session                              # continues this session
claude-queue resume-session -m "Finish the migration"    # with explicit instructions
claude-queue resume-session <session-id>                 # some other session
```

To continue an *earlier* session, find its id first:

```bash
claude-queue sessions                    # this project, newest first
claude-queue sessions ~/code/other       # some other project
claude-queue sessions --all              # every project
claude-queue sessions --search parser    # filter by title
```

Each row is a session id and the title Claude Code generated for it, so the id
can be copied straight into `resume-session`.

With no arguments it uses `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, so it works from inside the
session that hit the limit. At reset the queue reopens that conversation — the
whole history is intact, so work already done is not repeated.

The continuation runs non-interactively (`claude --print --resume`). Results land
in `~/.claude-queue/completed/`, and the session stays reopenable with
`claude --resume <session-id>` afterwards.

Queued jobs get this automatically: an interrupted job resumes its own session on
retry instead of restarting.

## Prompt Template Format

Template files live at `~/.claude-queue/queue/task-name.md`:

```markdown
---
priority: 0
working_directory: /absolute/path/to/project
context_files:
  - src/relevant-file.py
  - tests/test_relevant.py
max_retries: 3
estimated_tokens: null
model: null
---

# Task Title

Clear, self-contained description of what Claude Code should do.
Write as if there is no prior conversation context.

## Context

Background, constraints, or requirements.

## Expected Output

What should be delivered when done.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `priority` | **0 = highest**. Lower number executes first. |
| `working_directory` | Absolute path. Use the actual project path from context. |
| `context_files` | Paths relative to `working_directory`. Only include files that exist. |
| `max_retries` | Total attempts: `3` = 3 total, `-1` = unlimited, `1` = no retry. Rate-limit retries and failures share this counter. |
| `estimated_tokens` | Optional hint; set `null` if unknown. |
| `model` | Claude model ID. Omit or set `null` to use the configured default. |
| `resume_message` | Sent when continuing an interrupted attempt. Omit to use the configured default. |
| `claude_config_dir` | Claude Code profile to bill. Set automatically from `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` at queue time. |

The queue persists `session_id` before launch. Do not set it by hand. The
`resume-session` command also sets `resume_existing_session: true` so an older
Claude CLI cannot silently run the continuation as a new task.

### Priority Guidelines

- `0` — critical / blocks other work
- `1` — high priority (default for explicit user requests)
- `2` — normal work
- `5+` — background / batch jobs

## Deciding: `add` vs. Template File

**Use `claude-queue add`** when:
- Prompt is short (~200 chars or less)
- No context files needed
- Single, clear action

**Use a template file** when:
- Multi-step task needing structured instructions
- Context files should be attached
- The user will want to review or edit before running

For template files: construct the content and either run
`claude-queue template task-name` and show the user what to paste in, or
write the YAML+markdown content directly and tell the user to save it to
`~/.claude-queue/queue/task-name.md`.

## Template Bank (Reusable Templates)

```bash
claude-queue bank save daily-docs      # Create template in bank
claude-queue bank list                  # List saved templates
claude-queue bank use daily-docs        # Copy to active queue with new ID
claude-queue bank delete daily-docs     # Delete from bank
```

Bank templates live at `~/.claude-queue/bank/` and use the same YAML
frontmatter format. `bank use` copies them to the active queue —
templates themselves never execute directly.

## Batch Processing

For running the same task across many inputs:

```bash
claude-queue batch generate my-template --data entries.csv
claude-queue batch generate my-template --data entries.csv --dry-run
claude-queue batch variables my-template    # list {{placeholders}} in template
claude-queue batch validate my-template --data entries.csv
```

Batch templates use `{{variable}}` placeholders that match CSV column names:

```markdown
---
priority: 2
working_directory: /path/to/project
context_files: []
max_retries: 3
estimated_tokens: null
model: null
---

Refactor `{{filename}}` located at `{{filepath}}`:
- Update all calls from old_api() to new_api()
- Preserve existing tests
```

## Queue Directory Layout

```
~/.claude-queue/
├── queue/           # Active prompts (daemon reads these)
├── completed/       # Successfully finished
├── failed/          # Exhausted max_retries
├── bank/            # Saved reusable templates
└── queue-state.json
```

## Key Behavior Notes

**`--dangerously-skip-permissions`**: Passed to `claude` by default so the
daemon runs unattended. To disable interactive permission prompts:
`claude-queue start --no-skip-permissions`.

**Multiple accounts**: each Claude Code profile is a separate account and a
separate usage limit. A prompt records the active profile when queued (override
with `--profile DIR`), and one processor serves them all — when one account hits
its limit, work billed to the others keeps running.

**Resume message defaults**: set `resume_message` in the prompt, or
`resume_message:` in `.claude-queue.yaml` in the project directory, or in
`~/.claude-queue/config.yaml` queue-wide.

**At-least-once semantics**: If the daemon crashes mid-execution, the task
reruns on restart. Prompt users to design queued tasks to be idempotent
(safe to run twice) — especially for actions like "send email", "open PR",
"create payment", etc.

**Always suggest** running `claude-queue status --detailed` before starting
the daemon so the user can review what will execute.
