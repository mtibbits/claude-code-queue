# Claude Code Queue

A tool to queue Claude Code prompts and automatically execute them when token limits reset, preventing manual waiting during 5-hour limit windows.

## Features

-   **Markdown-based Queue**: Each prompt is a `.md` file with YAML frontmatter
-   **Automatic Rate Limit Handling**: Detects rate limits and waits for reset windows
-   **Priority System**: Execute high-priority prompts first
-   **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry failed and rate-limited prompts; both share the `max_retries` total-attempts counter
-   **Session Resume**: An interrupted prompt continues its conversation instead of starting over
-   **Session Listing**: Find any conversation's id and title to continue it later
-   **Multiple Accounts**: Each prompt records the Claude Code profile that pays for it; limits are tracked per account, so one exhausted account does not idle the rest
-   **Persistent Storage**: Queue survives system restarts
-   **Prompt Bank**: Save and reuse templates for recurring tasks
-   **Interactive Prompt Box**: Browse and select files interactively with fuzzy search
-   **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line interface

## Installation

```bash
pip install claude-code-queue
```

**Optional Rust TUI**: The interactive `prompt-box` feature requires opting in at
install time. To build it, you need the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) and:

```bash
BUILD_RUST=1 pip install claude-code-queue
```

Without `BUILD_RUST=1`, the rest of `claude-code-queue` installs and works
normally — only `claude-queue prompt-box` will be unavailable.

**Linux only**: building `prompt-box` also requires X11 development headers
(`libxcb-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `libxcb-devel` on Fedora/RHEL, `libxcb` on Arch).
At runtime, clipboard support requires `xclip` or `xsel` to be installed.

### Claude Code Skill (optional)

If you use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), install the bundled `/queue`
skill so Claude can help you construct and manage queue tasks:

```bash
claude-queue install-skill
```

This copies a `SKILL.md` to `~/.claude/skills/queue/`. After restarting Claude
Code, type `/queue` to invoke it directly, and Claude will also proactively
suggest queuing when a task is complex or likely to hit rate limits. Use
`--force` to update an existing installation after upgrading the package.

Or, for local development:

```bash
cd claude-code-queue
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

After installation, use the `claude-queue` command:

1. **Test Claude Code connection:**

    ```bash
    claude-queue test
    ```

2. **Add a quick prompt:**

    ```bash
    claude-queue add "Fix the authentication bug" --priority 1
    ```

3. **Create a detailed prompt template:**

    ```bash
    claude-queue template my-feature --priority 2
    # Edit ~/.claude-queue/queue/my-feature.md with your prompt
    ```

4. **Launch the interactive prompt box:**
    ```bash
    claude-queue prompt-box
    ```

5. **Start the queue processor:**
    ```bash
    claude-queue start
    ```

## Usage

### Adding Prompts

**Quick prompt:**

```bash
claude-queue add "Implement user authentication" --priority 1 --working-dir /path/to/project --model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

**Template for detailed prompt:**

```bash
claude-queue template auth-feature
```

This creates `~/.claude-queue/queue/auth-feature.md`:

```markdown
---
priority: 0
working_directory: .
context_files: []
max_retries: 3
estimated_tokens: null
model: null
---

# Prompt Title

Write your prompt here...

## Context

Any additional context or requirements...

## Expected Output

What should be delivered...
```

### Managing the Queue

**Check status:**

```bash
claude-queue status --detailed
```

**List prompts:**

```bash
claude-queue list --status queued
```

**Cancel a prompt:**

```bash
claude-queue cancel abc123
```

### Running the Queue

**Start processing:**

```bash
claude-queue start
```

**Start with verbose output:**

```bash
claude-queue start --verbose
```

### Continuing an Interrupted Session

When a queued prompt is interrupted — a usage limit, a crash, a timeout — the
next attempt continues the same Claude Code conversation rather than starting
from scratch, so work the interrupted attempt already finished is not repeated.
This is automatic; nothing needs configuring.

You can also queue a continuation of a session you were working in yourself.

**Find a session:**

```bash
claude-queue sessions                   # this project, newest first
claude-queue sessions ~/code/other      # some other project
claude-queue sessions --all             # every project
claude-queue sessions --search parser   # filter by title
claude-queue sessions --json            # machine-readable
```

```
SESSION ID                            LAST ACTIVE  TITLE
f5681db3-00b7-456d-9e50-07fdaa0e1ddf  just now     Refactor the parser
bee6b34b-9893-49e0-8c26-0a44e05b2cce  2h ago       Fix the flaky test
```

**Queue its continuation:**

```bash
claude-queue resume-session                             # the session you are in
claude-queue resume-session -m "Finish the migration"   # with explicit instructions
claude-queue resume-session <session-id>                # some other session
```

With no arguments it uses `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, so it can be run from inside
the session that just hit the limit. At reset the queue reopens that conversation
with its history intact.

The continuation runs in the directory the session was working in, whichever
directory you queue it from — a conversation resumed somewhere else would be
pointed at the wrong files. Pass `-d` to override.

If the account you were working on is the one that ran out, continue the session
on a different one with `--profile`; see
[Multiple Claude Code Profiles](#multiple-claude-code-profiles-multiple-accounts).

The continuation runs non-interactively via `claude --print --resume`, so its
result lands in `~/.claude-queue/completed/` rather than back in your terminal.
The session stays reopenable with `claude --resume <session-id>` afterwards, with
the queue's work already in its history.

## Prompt Bank (Template Management)

The Prompt Bank allows you to save and reuse templates for recurring tasks like daily documentation updates, weekly reports, or standard maintenance tasks.

### Saving Templates to Bank

**Create a new template in the bank:**

```bash
claude-queue bank save update-docs --priority 1
```

This creates `~/.claude-queue/bank/update-docs.md` which you can edit:

```markdown
---
priority: 1
working_directory: /path/to/project
context_files:
  - README.md
  - docs/
max_retries: 3
estimated_tokens: 1500
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
---

# Update Project Documentation

Please review and update the project documentation:

## Tasks
1. Update README.md with latest features
2. Check code examples are current
3. Update API documentation
4. Fix any broken links

## Context
This is the daily documentation review task.
```

### Managing Templates

**List available templates:**

```bash
claude-queue bank list
```

**Use a template (adds to queue):**

```bash
claude-queue bank use update-docs
```

**Delete a template:**

```bash
claude-queue bank delete update-docs
```

### Typical Workflow for Recurring Tasks

1. **One-time setup:**
   ```bash
   # Create and customize your template
   claude-queue bank save daily-standup --priority 1
   # Edit ~/.claude-queue/bank/daily-standup.md with your specific requirements
   ```

2. **Daily usage:**
   ```bash
   # Simply add to queue whenever needed
   claude-queue bank use daily-standup
   claude-queue start
   ```

This eliminates the need to recreate the same prompt structure every time!

## Interactive Prompt Box

The prompt box provides an interactive terminal UI for browsing and selecting files with fuzzy search capabilities.

### Launching the Prompt Box

```bash
claude-queue prompt-box
```

### Features

- **Fuzzy File Search**: Type to filter files by name or path
- **Real-time Preview**: See file contents as you navigate
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to browse files
- **File Selection**: Select files to include in prompts
- **Directory Traversal**: Browse through project directories
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy file paths or contents

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Input Mode:**
- `↑/↓`: Navigate history
- `←/→`: Move cursor left/right
- `Home/End`: Move cursor to beginning/end
- `Enter`: Submit input
- `Tab`: Trigger file picker for @ mentions
- `Ctrl+C`: Copy to clipboard
- `Ctrl+Q`: Quit application

**Picker Mode (file selection):**
- `↑/↓`: Navigate through files
- `Enter`: Select current file
- `Esc`: Exit picker mode
- Type to search files with fuzzy matching

The prompt box is built with Rust for fast file indexing and responsive UI, making it easy to explore large codebases and select relevant files for your Claude Code prompts.

## How It Works

1. **Queue Processing**: Runs prompts in priority order (lower number = higher priority)
2. **Rate Limit Detection**: Monitors Claude Code output for rate limit messages
3. **Automatic Waiting**: When rate limited, parses the actual reset time from Claude's output when available; falls back to estimating the next 5-hour window boundary otherwise
4. **Retry Logic**: Failed prompts are retried up to `max_retries` total attempts, continuing the conversation the interrupted attempt started rather than repeating it from the beginning. Interrupted prompts (from crashes or ungraceful shutdowns) are automatically re-queued on the next startup — **at-least-once semantics apply**: a task that finished but whose result was not saved before a crash will run again. Design tasks to be idempotent where possible.
5. **File Organization**:
    - `~/.claude-queue/queue/` - Pending prompts
    - `~/.claude-queue/completed/` - Successful executions
    - `~/.claude-queue/failed/` - Failed prompts
    - `~/.claude-queue/bank/` - Saved template library
    - `~/.claude-queue/queue-state.json` - Queue metadata
6. **Execution Logs**: After each execution attempt, a log is appended to the prompt's `.md` file for human inspection. The log is automatically stripped before the prompt is sent to Claude, so Claude always receives only the original prompt text regardless of how many times the task has been retried.

## Configuration

### Command Line Options

```bash
claude-queue --help
```

Key options:

-   `--storage-dir`: Queue storage location (default: `~/.claude-queue`)
-   `--claude-command`: Claude CLI command (default: `claude`)
-   `--check-interval`: Check interval in seconds (default: 30)
-   `--timeout`: Command timeout in seconds (default: 3600)

### Prompt Configuration

Each prompt supports these YAML frontmatter options:

```yaml
---
priority: 1 # Execution priority (0 = highest)
working_directory: /path/to/project # Where to run the prompt
context_files: # Files to include as context
    - src/main.py
    - README.md
max_retries: 3 # Maximum total execution attempts (1 = no retries, -1 = unlimited)
estimated_tokens: 1000 # Estimated token usage (optional)
model: claude-sonnet-4-6 # Claude model ID (optional; null uses the configured default)
resume_message: null # Sent when continuing an interrupted attempt (optional)
---
```

**`max_retries` semantics:** this field controls the total number of execution attempts, not the number of retries after the first failure. `max_retries: 3` means 3 total attempts (initial + 2 retries); `max_retries: 1` means a single attempt with no retries; `max_retries: -1` means unlimited retries. Rate-limited executions and failure retries share the same counter.

### Resume Message

The message sent when continuing an interrupted session resolves most-specific
first:

1. `resume_message` in the prompt's frontmatter
2. `resume_message:` in `.claude-queue.yaml` in the prompt's working directory
3. `resume_message:` in `config.yaml` in the storage directory
4. A built-in default

```yaml
# .claude-queue.yaml — applies to every prompt run in this project
resume_message: >
    Continue from where the previous attempt stopped. Check what is already
    committed before changing anything.
```

Blank values fall through to the next level rather than resuming with an empty
prompt, and a malformed config warns on stderr and falls back to the default
instead of stopping the queue.

`session_id` also appears in the frontmatter once a prompt has run. It is managed
by the queue — it records the conversation to continue — and is not meant to be
edited by hand.

### Multiple Claude Code Profiles (Multiple Accounts)

Claude Code keeps its state under `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when that variable is set
and `~/.claude` otherwise. Each config directory holds its own credentials, so
**a profile is an account, with its own usage limit**. Running a personal profile
and two work profiles means three separate limits — and three separate bills.

The queue follows the same variable, so `install-skill` installs into the active
profile and `sessions` lists that profile's conversations.

#### Choosing which account pays

The profile is recorded on the prompt when it is queued, not left to whichever
profile the processor happens to run under. Three equivalent forms:

```bash
# the active profile — whatever $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR points at
claude-queue add "a task"

# a different profile, for this command only
claude-queue add "a task" --profile ~/.claude-personal

# or by environment, for the whole shell
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-personal claude-queue add "a task"
```

Each prints what it recorded, so the account is never a guess:

```
✓ Added prompt 4cb9ea14 to queue
  Profile: /Users/you/.claude-personal
```

The same applies to `resume-session`.

#### Scenario: spreading work across accounts

Queue everything into one queue and label each job with the account that should
pay for it:

```bash
claude-queue add "refactor the parser"  --profile ~/.claude-work   -p 1
claude-queue add "write release notes"  --profile ~/.claude-work-2 -p 1
claude-queue add "tidy my dotfiles"     --profile ~/.claude        -p 5
claude-queue start
```

**Limits are tracked per account.** When `~/.claude-work` hits its limit, the
processor keeps running the jobs billed to the other two and comes back to the
work account once its window reopens. A single exhausted account no longer idles
the whole queue.

#### Scenario: your session hits the limit — continue it on another account

A session started on one account can be continued on another. The transcript
lives on disk, so `--resume` replays it as context; the account only decides who
pays.

```bash
# from inside the session that hit the limit
claude-queue sessions                                   # find its id
claude-queue resume-session <session-id> --profile ~/.claude-personal
claude-queue start
```

The continuation picks the conversation up with its full history — work already
done is not repeated — and spends the personal account's budget instead of the
exhausted one.

This depends on the other profile being able to see the transcript. Each profile
stores conversations under its own `projects/` directory, so cross-account
resume works when profiles share that directory (symlinking it, for example) and
not otherwise.

#### What the queue cannot tell you

Claude Code does not record which account created a session — there is no account
field in the transcript. The queue therefore cannot warn you that you are
continuing a conversation on a different account's budget. Picking the right
profile is your call; the queue only makes the choice explicit and visible.

#### Prompts with no profile recorded

A prompt queued by hand, or before this field existed, has no `claude_config_dir`.
It bills to whatever the processor is running under and is rate-limited together
with it, rather than looking like a separate account and dodging a limit it
actually shares. Add the field to pin it down:

```yaml
claude_config_dir: /Users/you/.claude-work
```

#### One processor per storage directory

A second `start` on the same storage directory exits with an error instead of
executing every prompt twice. With per-prompt profiles a single processor already
covers every account, so a second one is rarely wanted. Commands that only read
or write files (`add`, `status`, `list`, `bank`, `sessions`) run freely alongside
a running processor.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Add a simple prompt
claude-queue add "Run tests and fix any failures" --priority 1

# Create template for complex prompt
claude-queue template database-migration --priority 2

# Launch interactive file browser
claude-queue prompt-box

# Save a reusable template
claude-queue bank save update-docs --priority 1

# Use a saved template
claude-queue bank use update-docs

# Start processing
claude-queue start
```

### Complex Prompt Template

```markdown
---
priority: 1
working_directory: /Users/me/my-project
context_files:
    - src/auth.py
    - tests/test_auth.py
    - docs/auth-requirements.md
max_retries: 2
estimated_tokens: 2000

# Fix Authentication Bug

There's a bug in the user authentication system where users can't log in with special characters in their passwords.

## Context

-   The issue affects passwords containing @, #, $ symbols
-   Error occurs in the password validation function
-   Tests are failing in test_auth.py

## Requirements

1. Fix the password validation to handle special characters
2. Update tests to cover edge cases
3. Ensure backward compatibility

## Expected Output

-   Fixed authentication code
-   Updated test cases
-   Documentation update if needed
```

## Rate Limit Handling

The system automatically detects Claude Code rate limits by monitoring:

-   "usage limit reached" messages
-   Claude's reset time information
-   Standard rate limit error patterns

When rate limited:

1. Prompt status changes to `rate_limited`
2. The queue determines the reset time using a two-tier strategy:
    - **Parsed reset time**: extracts the actual reset time from Claude's output when available
    - **Estimated reset time**: falls back to estimating the next 5-hour window boundary (00:00–05:00, 05:00–10:00, 10:00–15:00, 15:00–20:00, 20:00–01:00) based on the current time
3. Once the reset time is reached, the prompt is re-queued and the conversation is continued from where it stopped, so work already done is not repeated

## Troubleshooting

**Queue not processing:**

```bash
# Check Claude Code connection
claude-queue test

# Check queue status
claude-queue status --detailed
```

**Prompts stuck in executing state:**

Interrupted prompts are **automatically re-queued** on the next startup — no manual intervention is needed. Simply restart the queue:

```bash
claude-queue start
```

> **Warning — at-least-once execution:** If the daemon was killed after Claude finished but before the result was saved to disk, the task will run again on restart. Design tasks to be idempotent (safe to run more than once) where possible.

**Rate limit not detected:**

-   Check if Claude Code output format changed
-   File an issue with the error message you received
